# unified-mentor-first-project-heart-disease

## Description

The Heart Disease Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on health-related features. Using a real-world medical dataset, the project analyzes patient data such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors to classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease. This helps in early detection and preventive healthcare.

## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to analyze health data and predict heart disease. The aim is to assist medical practitioners and individuals in identifying high-risk cases early. The project uses Python for data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Concepts Included

The coding in this project covers several key concepts in data analysis and machine learning:

1. **Data Handling with Pandas**

   * Patient data is loaded and managed using the Pandas library.
   * Features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina are cleaned and prepared for modeling.

2. **Data Visualization**

   * **Bar Graphs:** Compare categorical variables like gender distribution or prevalence of heart disease by age group.
   * **Histograms:** Show the distribution of numerical features such as cholesterol, age, and blood pressure.
   * **Pie Charts:** Visualize proportions, like the percentage of patients with and without heart disease.

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Transforming raw data into meaningful features for better prediction.
   * Includes encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical values.

4. **Machine Learning Models**

   * Classification models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests) are used to predict the presence of heart disease.
   * The model is trained and tested on the dataset, and performance metrics are evaluated.

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices are used to assess the performance of the prediction model.
   * Helps in understanding the reliability and effectiveness of the prediction.

## How to Use

1. Load the dataset using Python and Pandas.
2. Preprocess and clean the data.
3. Train a classification model on the dataset.
4. Visualize insights using bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts.
5. Evaluate the model to predict heart disease risk.

## Tools & Libraries

* **Python** – Main programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For visualizations (bar graphs, histograms, pie charts).
* **Scikit-learn** – For building and evaluating machine learning models.
